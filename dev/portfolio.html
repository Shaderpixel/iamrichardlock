                A large portion of my projects revolves around my professional experiences at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. I also occasionally take on freelance projects and competitions to broaden my experiences. Regardless of who my clients are or the size of the project scope, each project offers me a unique set of challenges on how to create a web platform that is performant and user friendly using my expert knowledge in front-end web development and UX design.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also intentionally incorporate experimental browser features in a number of my projects through progressive enhancement as means to challenge myself to learn web technologies find ways to apply them as solutions to my clientâ€™s needs. Here are highlights of some of my recent projects.

                         The University's web framework underwent a major version upgrade to adopt the latest industry
                         web technologies and accessibility best practices. This include styles and template
                         markup that align with newer CSS specs such as CSS Grids, CSS
                         methodologies such as BEMIT for consistent class names, and accessibility standards such
                         as defining proper landmark regions and use of ARIA attributes.
                         The update also aimed to improve page load and rendering performance.
                         The framework upgrade is split into two projects, a brand agnostic framework that can be
                         shared and reused among other institutions within the university system - DCF, and a University
                         theme that is built on top of it.

                         In this project, I led the effort to evaluate build tools and architect the build
                         process needed to distribute the DCF library. This include researching build tools such as
                         Webpack and Gulp and their plugin ecosystem, and making a decision based on the business use
                         case and requirements. Then I wrote the build processes needed to generate the code
                         base for the library using composition patterns. I also improved upon the existing theme
                         layer build processes by cleaning up the codebase and wrote new tasks needed to work
                         alongside DCF. I also wrote documentation for DCF and theme layer build processes.
                         I also wrote code for plugin initialization and widgets that the team hope to
                         incorporate into the framework. Lastly, I also created theme UI prototypes for UX testing and
                         contributed code and styles to both the framework and theme layer.

                         application. The application uses Next.JS with React for server side
                         rendering and Apollo for cache and state management. The backend stack uses Prisma
                         for data storage and exposing a single GraphQL endpoint and Yoga allows me to selectively
                         expose GQL types and methods that are automatically generated by Prisma. Yoga also allowed
                         me to write custom query and mutation resolvers to manipulate CRUD operations and check for
                         login via JWTs and access privileges. I also wrote unit and snapshot tests for components using Jest and
                         Enzyme.

                         created. Permissions to edit existing items are given to item creators or users with
                         the correct permissions. There is a permissions screen that displays all the users and their
                         permissions to allow admins or users with the correct privileges to edit user permissions. The
                         app features a cart system that buyers can add items to and checkout via Stripe payment method.

                         within the Redux dev tools to inspect the state mutation. This personal project helped me to
                         understand the concept of state vs store, actions, action creators, dispatching actions,
                         reducers, and the benefits of redux such as allowing us to easily pass store data to deeply
                         nested components.</p>

                         This React single page client side app is a personal project from a workshop. It features an
                         e-commerce store front with a cart and inventory management. Inventory data is stored on
                         Google's Firebase cloud storage. I created this app to help me learn the basics of React including concepts
                         such as state, props, hot reload, two-way data bindings, re-usability and differences of
                         class-based and functional components, and lifecycle methods. I also utilized packages such
                         as React router, CSS Transitions, and PropTypes for prop checking. The app is deployed to multiple
                         environment such as Netlify, Apache, Now, and Github pages so that I can familiarize myself
                         with how single page application deployment requires routing to be all done through a single
                         entry point.

                         I also make use of a spacious design to clearly define steps on how to obtain a new card. I
                         re-purposed a piece of

                         One of the most important pieces of content on this site is the policies for the
                         University's operations. Certain policies are updated frequently but there was not an easy
                         way to communicate which policy has been updated. Using Drupal features, I built a view
                         that pulls in policies sorted by their most recently updated date and present it as a block
                         on the homepage. Using a spacious design and concise text, I created a clean design that
                         quickly communicates what each of the homepage section is about. I also elevated the awards
                         recipient section, giving it the section acknowledgement that it previously lacks.

The OpenAIR Competition matches participants with nonprofit organizations and artists to help them build accessible websites that they would otherwise have difficulty achieving. Grading is then performed according to an accessibility rubrik. Web accessibility training, and exposure to Assistive Technologies and audit tools were part of the educational component of this competition. As part of the Inclusive Lab team, we were paired up with ACBN to redesign their website and to ensure that the new site meets WCAG 2.0 Success criterias. We also made extra efforts to ensure that the content organization and information architecture (IA) feels logical and that good UX criterias are met. My contribution included content and IA organization, creating mockups, theming, and QA testing. The site was tested against Voice Over and Jaws.

Some of the challenges that I faced in this project include trying to include appealing visual design components and elements that can be reused throughout the entire website and manipulating text-heavy content pages into easily digestible pieces and display them using Drupal features. It can be difficult to represent certain units such as Building Fire & Safety through appealing photos. To solve my problem, I used SVG text and filled them with relevant images, creating a clip effect. The image is darkened and multiplied for accessibility purposes and this also help reduce the image file size. Double win!</p>

The elaborate website design was put together by Archrival and was implemented and launched in a time span of two weeks in November 2017. My task was to implement the design in a custom Drupal theme. PHP was used in template files for theming and templating content types. The site uses the Intersection Observer API to show additional content past a certain scroll point on the Show pages. Logic is also written in PHP to disable past showtime ticket links and hide content when show dates have expired. Drupal View was also used to sort and display shows based on their show dates. <br>

I chosed Squarespace primarily for its easy to use and yet customizable features and its responsive web templates. I modified an existing theme and tacked on my own custom CSS and JavaScript. I wrote a custom video loader for the hero banner that will play a looping video only for non-mobile devices. This approach provides a better user expereicne for mobile-device users who visits the site since it will consume less battery and mobile data on their devices. The default video feature loads video from services that also displays their logo and video controls which are undesirable. Site was launched in June of 2017.</p>

I also used JavaScript to reorganize the page layout and content to improve content flow.
